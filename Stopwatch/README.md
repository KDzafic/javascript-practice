# Gold Stopwatch Project

## Project Overview

The Gold Stopwatch is a web-based stopwatch application with a sleek, modern design. This application allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch with precision timing down to milliseconds. The design features a "gold" theme, with interactive buttons styled using CSS transitions.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the stopwatch.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the stopwatch interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the stopwatch functionality.

## HTML Explanation (`index.html`)

The HTML file includes a heading, a display area for the time, and control buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch. The buttons use Font Awesome icons for a modern look.

### Key Elements:

- `<h1>`: Displays the title of the stopwatch.
- `<div id="stopwatch">`: Contains the display for the elapsed time.
- `<div id="buttons">`: Contains the start, stop, and reset buttons.

## CSS Explanation (`style.css`)

The CSS file is responsible for the overall appearance of the stopwatch.

### Key Styles:

- **Body**: The background color is set to a dark shade, with text colored white for contrast.
- **Heading (`h1`)**: The heading uses the "Montserrat" font, with the word "GOLD" highlighted in gold color and a glowing text shadow.
- **Stopwatch Display (`#stopwatch span`)**: The time display is styled to be large and centered, with a white border and rounded corners.
- **Buttons**: The buttons are styled as circular, with transitions on hover and active states to change colors smoothly.
- **text-shadow: 0 0 0px #fff, 0 0 50px #f2c94c**: The first shadow doesn't really contribute visually because of the 0px blur. The second shadow creates a glowing effect around the text in a light yellow color.

## JavaScript Explanation (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file manages the core functionality of the stopwatch, including starting, stopping, resetting, and updating the time display.

### Key Functions:

#### `start()`

- **Purpose**: Begins the stopwatch timer.
- **How It Works**:
  1. The function first checks if the stopwatch is already running by evaluating the `isRunning` variable. If `isRunning` is `false`, the stopwatch is not running, so it proceeds to start it.
  2. `startTime` is calculated by subtracting the `elapsedTime` from the current time (`Date.now()`). This allows the stopwatch to resume from where it left off if it was stopped previously.
  3. An interval is created using `setInterval(update, 10)`, which calls the `update()` function every 10 milliseconds to refresh the displayed time.
  4. The `isRunning` flag is set to `true` to indicate that the stopwatch is now active.
  5. The start button is hidden, and the stop and reset buttons are displayed to reflect the new state.

#### `stop()`

- **Purpose**: Stops the stopwatch timer.
- **How It Works**:
  1. The function checks if the stopwatch is currently running (`isRunning` is `true`).
  2. If it is running, `clearInterval(timerId)` is called to stop the `update()` function from being called at the set interval.
  3. The `elapsedTime` is updated to reflect the total time that has passed since the stopwatch started or was last resumed.
  4. The `isRunning` flag is set to `false` to indicate that the stopwatch has stopped.
  5. The start button is made visible again, allowing the user to resume timing, while the stop button remains visible and active.

#### `reset()`

- **Purpose**: Resets the stopwatch to its initial state.
- **How It Works**:
  1. The function stops the interval using `clearInterval(timerId)` to ensure that the stopwatch is no longer running.
  2. The timer ID is reset to `null`, and both `startTime` and `elapsedTime` are reset to `0`.
  3. The `isRunning` flag is set to `false` to indicate that the stopwatch is not active.
  4. The start button is shown, while the stop and reset buttons are hidden.
  5. The displayed time (`#time`) is reset to "00:00:00:00", reflecting the initial state of the stopwatch.

#### `update()`

- **Purpose**: Updates the displayed time on the stopwatch.
- **How It Works**:
  1. The function first calculates the current time using `Date.now()`.
  2. `elapsedTime` is calculated by subtracting `startTime` from the current time. This gives the total time that has passed since the stopwatch started or resumed.
  3. The `elapsedTime` is broken down into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds:
     - **Hours**: Calculated by dividing `elapsedTime` by the number of milliseconds in an hour (`1000 * 60 * 60`).
     - **Minutes**: Calculated by dividing `elapsedTime` by the number of milliseconds in a minute (`1000 * 60`) and then using the remainder (`% 60`) to get the minutes.
     - **Seconds**: Calculated by dividing `elapsedTime` by 1000 (milliseconds per second) and then using the remainder (`% 60`) to get the seconds.
     - **Milliseconds**: Calculated by taking the remainder of `elapsedTime` divided by 1000 and then dividing by 10 to get the centiseconds.
  4. Each value is padded with leading zeros to ensure a consistent two-digit format using `String(value).padStart(2, 0)`.
  5. The formatted time string is updated in the DOM element with the ID `time`, displaying the elapsed time in the format "HH:MM:SS:CC" (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds).

## Additional Notes

This project showcases a combination of modern web technologies, including responsive design with CSS and dynamic behavior with JavaScript. The usage of external libraries like Font Awesome adds to the polished appearance of the stopwatch. The CSS transitions and hover effects create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.
