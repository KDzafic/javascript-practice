The defer attribute is particularly important and has the following effects:

- Defer Loading: The defer attribute tells the browser to download the script in the background while it continues to parse the HTML. This means the script won't block the HTML parsing, which can help improve the page load time.

- Execute After Parsing: The script will only be executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed. This ensures that any DOM elements the script interacts with are already available in the document.

- Execution Order: If you have multiple scripts with the defer attribute, they will be executed in the order they appear in the document, which is different from scripts with the async attribute.

In summary, using defer is a good practice when you want your JavaScript to run after the HTML is fully parsed, without blocking the page loading process.
